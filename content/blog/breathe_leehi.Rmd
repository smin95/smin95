Breathe is one of my favorite songs. Several covers have been recorded. Here are my favorites.

Han's control of dynamic is amazing. His arrangement strays from the original but is absolutely beautiful. 

### Kyu Hyun

His voice is beautiful. Very clear and resonant. This rendition is very faithful to the original
