      <description>Here are some of my favorite clarinet clips. I have watched them countless times.
Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker for the clarinet and orchestraSergey’s playing is so lyrical. He sings with the clarinet. I can listen to his playing all day.
Rossini’s Introduction, Theme and VariationsValentin’s articulation is god-level. His conducting is also god-level. Everything about this so god. His cadenza in the end is legendary!
Spohr #2 concertoThe soloist effortlessly plays this notoriously difficult piece.</description>

      <description>Breathe is one of my favorite songs. Many covers have been recorded. Here are my favorites.
Original by Lee hiThis is the original recording of the song.
Han Dong GeunHan’s control of dynamic is amazing. His arrangement strays from the original but is absolutely beautiful.
Kyu HyunHis voice is beautiful. Very clear and resonant. This rendition is very faithful to the original</description>
