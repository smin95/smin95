    <p>I play the clarinet as a hobby although I used to play it competitively during high school. Unfortunately, since I began my undergraduate studies, I have stopped receiving lessons, which are quite expensive. So during undergrad, my playing ability rarely improved. However, perhaps thanks to COVID-19, I have had more spare time recently and have been able to find practice routines that have worked for me to become a better player.</p>
<p>These practice routines include exercises that I believe I can improve infinitely. They include long-tone and scale exercises (i.e., not so interesting stuff) but not a piece. To spice up my routine, I decided to one day include a piece in my routine: Flight of the Bumblebee by Rimsky-Korsakov.</p>
<p><img src="/img/bumblebee.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This piece is essentially a non-stop chromatic scale at a very fast tempo. It requires you to place your fingers close to the keys and minimize the motor movement for each note. Although this piece is in the key of C for the piano and the flute, since the clarinet is in Bb, it is in D major (two sharps). I think a clarinet repertoire in D major requires a lot of dexterity from the left hand, so this is an excellent piece for those who are right handed.</p>
<p>To really master each note of the piece, one needs to play this piece slowly. I started practicing this piece at a tempo of 90 beats per minute. Then I gradually increased it all the way to 180. It took a few months of concentrated practice for my hands to really master it. Here is the end result.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<h3 id="heading"></h3>
<p>Once, I was able to reach a tempo of 200 beats per minute. Then, I asked myself, &lsquo;what now?&rsquo; It turned out I could play this piece all double-tongued. If I &lsquo;tongued&rsquo; all the notes, each note would be detached and articulated because my tongue would touch the reed of the clarinet to block the air flow. I realized playing this piece with a non-stop double tongue was much more difficult than slurring (i.e., connecting) all the notes. So, I guess it will be my next challenge (for the next couple years). I usually double-tongue (i.e, ta-ka-ta-ka) rather than single-tongue (ta-ta-ta) in typical clarinet repertoires, such as pieces by Mozart, Weber and Spohr. However, a long passage of non-stop articulation is very rare in the clarinet repertoire. So, I guess this exercise will improve my articulation too.</p>
